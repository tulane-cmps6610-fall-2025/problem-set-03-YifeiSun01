- **1b.**

Because we are checking by index of every element in the list to see if it is the element we are looking or not, the work and span are both $O(n)$. 



- **1d.**

Work (T₁): Θ(n) — each element is compared once and participates in O(1) combines overall; parallel reduction is work-efficient. 
Span (T∞): Θ(log n) — the reduction combines results up a balanced tree of depth ~log n (comparisons can be done in parallel, then the OR tree dominates).
